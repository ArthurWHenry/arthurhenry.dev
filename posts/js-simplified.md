While interviewing, I started to take some simplified JavaScript notes and figured I could start sharing some of them.

Async/Await: A function that knows to expect a promise with the await keyword

Callbacks: A function that is passed into another as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action

Promises: An object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

Closures: A combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).

Synchronous Code: As the name suggests, operations run in sequence, one by one.

Asynchronous Code: Allows a program to be executed immediately.
