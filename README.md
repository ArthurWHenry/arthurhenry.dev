# arthurhenry.dev

## Introduction

This is my personal website built using Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and the Spotify Web API. After trying several times to make a website that feels like me, I was able to create this.

### Inspiration

- [0xhjohnson's personal website](https://0xhjohnson.com/)

## Installation

To start working with this project install all necessary dependencies with the following command.

```bash
yarn
```

Next, to run it on your local machine run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

That will set up the dev environment.

The project requires some environment variables from Spotify. You can replace them with your own if you wish to use the project.

## Special Thanks

As mentioned in the introduction, my inspiration was @0xhjohnson's website. He also spent some time helping me understand how the Spotify API works and some specifics of TypeScript.
